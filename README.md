# Cozy-Html-Css-VanillaJS-Projects
## Description
This project will be part of my journey as Developer, more specific this will help me learn and practice Front-end Development.

The project will be formed by 20 little projects which will have a specific function in mind while being developed. 

I will be adding subheadings with description on each while writing this projects.

I plan to upload on the web every project so they can have a live-demo. The links will be added below each project description.

### 1st project: Form Validator
I already have a set of tools that are meant to be used for Form-Validation but this time I wanted to start with something like this so I could practice CSS and more simple and scalable HTML+CSS+ES6.
### 2nd project: Movie Seat Booking
In this project I practiced CSS on divs, different effects, on click, on hover...etc
Also practiced to save data to the local storage using Javascript.
And populate the page data with the saved data in local storage.
### 3d project: Custom Video Player
In this project practiced the custom controls on a Video, with CSS giving custom nice good look to the player.
Javascript to change the appearence of the Play/Pause button, and also to calculate seconds and minutes, populate UI and be able to drag bar to a desired location of the video.
### 4th project: Exchange Rate Calculator
In this project as in all projects of this series practiced CSS, and mostly ES6 Javascript clean methods to Fetch Exchange API with Async/Await functions and JSON Data.
### 5th project: DOM Array Methods
Here worked with Array methods to modify the DOM, Fetch with Await/Async and generate random data which will be used to map,sort,filter and reduce.
### 6th project: Landing page with Modal
This is a typical landing page we see tons of times on a daily basis, but wanted to practice the CSS and Javascript needed to hide and show a Modal window, also the transitions when toggling the nav-bar and modal. 
### 7th project: Hangman Game
This is a Hangman game, made only with HTML CSS and ES6 Javascript, learned more about styling and learned to work with SVG and Lines and Circle to draw the hanging man. Also used Fetch API to call an API to get random words. 
### 8th project: Meal Finder App
This project is so far the one that I most like. Learned a ton of useful Front-End resources. Practiced more CSS media-queries, but the thing I practiced the most in this project is Vanilla Javascript. 
Used TheMealDB free API https://www.themealdb.com/api.php, Fetch API to get the data, and a LOT of DOM modifying because we want to create our items dynamically.

Is amazing how we complicate our lifes using JQuery and Libaries, I'm not against them, but for example: I wanted to make the scroll effect when I click a meal to scroll to the generated div, and I researched on StackOverflow and Google how to do it. And almost every result included JQuery or 45 lines of code. So in my persistence looking for a Vanilla JS solution, I found out about the Element.scrollIntoView(options); _GAMECHANGING_ , in one line of code I got what I wanted.
